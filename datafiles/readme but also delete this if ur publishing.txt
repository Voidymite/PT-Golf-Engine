This is a reminder:

Hey, player/developer/modder!

All sounds are set to "Uncompress on Load", which means the sounds are compressed in the game files so they take up less computer space. When the game runs, before fully launching it has to decode and uncompress the audio before it can use and load all of it. This takes time and it may turn out looking like the game isn't launching or is bugged. Don't think this! Just be patient and wait for the game to launch, please.
