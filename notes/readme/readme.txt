Thanks to you for checking this out too

This decomp works on 2023.6 >= 2023.11 (hopefully)
2022/LTS may work but Probably definitely not I can't check

You CANNOT play the full GOLF build with this decomp since I was too lazy to fully add doors to the rooms 
(GOLF era doesn't use targetDoors and uses target_x and target_y instead when going to the next room 
through a hallway/door). You may add the doors to the rest of the rooms yourself if you want, it's easy to 
do.
On that topic, the door sprites are made by me.

I also changed the distracting mach sounds to the SAGE>> ones, with some volume tweaks. Some other sounds
were modernized, too. Most songs and music were removed to save storage, and prefixes were changed to mu_
and sfx_ instead of music_ and sound_. General performance optimizations were also made. Everything is 
sorted into folders neatly aswell.

You may use this as an engine for fangames or mods, I don't care.
But I can't stress it enough, CREDIT ME WHEN YOU USE THIS DECOMP FOR ANYTHING. Unless you're just checking 
it out, if you plan on publishing anything using this decomp, credit me.

Also, enemies are really broken. I don't know how to fix that right now. Try taking your hand at it until 
I do.

Fun fact:
This decomp was made in only 2 days.
